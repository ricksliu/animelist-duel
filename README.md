# animelist-duel

Website that compares MyAnimeList users. Uses React, Spring Boot and MongoDB.

## About

The frontend uses React, TypeScript, SASS and Material UI. The backend uses Spring Boot and MongoDB.

The backend scrapes MyAnimeList pages and extracts the data for users using regular expressions. The results are stored using MongoDB for a period of time so the same data is not scraped repeatedly.
